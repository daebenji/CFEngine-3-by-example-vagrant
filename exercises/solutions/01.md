1. Can you find a promise that is activated on any agent?

        The promise with handle `main_methods_firewall_open_cf_serverd` is
        classed to `any::`.

2. Can you find a promise that is activated on agents that identify as a policy
hub?

        The promise with handle `main_commands_report` is classed to `am_policy_hub::`.

3. Can you find a promise that is activated on agents that do not identify as a
policy hub? 

        The promise with handle `main_commands_echo_hi_wall` is classed to
        `!am_policy_hub.from_cfexecd::`. Promises after this class expression will be
        considered for activation on agents that do not have am_policy_hub defined and
        have from_cfexecd defined. from_cfexecd is an automatic class that is defined
        when the agent is executed from cf-execd.

4. Add a new promise to Shutdown/halt machines that execute the agent from
cf_execd and are not policy hubs

        Add the following promise after `!am_policy_hub.from_cfexecd::`.

        "/sbin/shutdown"
          handle => "main_commands_shutdown",
          args => "-h now",
          comment => "Poweroff remote clients";
