#. Can you find a promise that is activated on any agent?

    A. The promise with handle `main_methods_firewall_open_cf_serverd` is
classed to `any::`.

#. Can you find a promise that is activated on agents that identify as a policy
hub?

    A. The promise with handle `main_commands_report` is classed to `am_policy_hub::`.

#. Can you find a promise that is activated on agents that do not identify as a
policy hub? 

    A. The promise with handle `main_commands_echo_hi_wall` is classed to
`!am_policy_hub.from_cfexecd::`. Promises after this class expression will be
considered for activation on agents that do not have am_policy_hub defined and
have from_cfexecd defined. from_cfexecd is an automatic class that is defined
when the agent is executed from cf-execd.

#. Add a new promise to Shutdown/halt machines that execute the agent from
cf_execd and are not policy hubs

    A. Add the following promise after `!am_policy_hub.from_cfexecd::`.

    "/sbin/shutdown"
      handle => "main_commands_shutdown",
      args => "-h now",
      comment => "Poweroff remote clients";
